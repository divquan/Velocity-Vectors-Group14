\begin{frame}{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Welcome to the presentation on "Velocity and Its Application."
        \item In this presentation, we will explore the concept of velocity in calculus, specifically focusing
on the vector-based velocity, and examine its practical applications in the field of computer
engineering.
        \item Let's dive in!

%% Section Two
\section{Understanding Velocity in Calculus}


\begin{frame}[t]{Understanding velocity in Calculus}
    \vspace{20pt}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Velocity is a fundamental concept in calculus that describes the rate of change of an
object's position with respect to time.  
        \item In vector calculus, velocity is represented as a vector quantity, taking into account both
magnitude and direction.
        \item In vector calculus, velocity is represented as a vector quantity, taking into account both
magnitude and direction.
        \item The formula for velocity in vector calculus is 
          \begin{equation*}
        V = \frac{dR}{dt},
        \end{equation*}
        where V represents the velocity
vector, R is the position vector, and dt is the change in time.

%% Section Three
\section{Velocity Vector in 2D and 3D}

\begin{frame}[t]{Velocity Vector in 2D and 3D}
    \vspace{15pt} % Add vertical space of 5pt

    \begin{block}{2D Velocity Vector}
        In 2D, the velocity vector can be expressed as $ V = (V_{x}, V_{y})$ where $V_{x}$ is the horizontal
        component and $V_{y}$ is the vertical component.
    \end{block}
    \vspace{5pt} % Add vertical space of 5pt

    \begin{block}{3D Velocity Vector}
        In 3D, the velocity vector becomes $\mathbf{V} = (V_x, V_y, V_z)$, with $V_x$, $V_y$, and $V_z$ representing the components along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively.
    \end{block}
  
\end{frame}


%% Section Four
\section{Deriving Velocity from Position Vector}

\begin{frame}{Deriving Velocity from Position Vector}

To find the velocity vector from the position vector, we differentiate the position vector with respect to time (dt).

\vspace{8pt}
For a 2D position vector $R(t) = (x(t), y(t))$, the velocity vector $V(t) = \left(\frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}\right)$.

\vspace{8pt}
For a 3D position vector $R(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$, the velocity vector $V(t) = \left(\frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}, \frac{dz}{dt}\right)$.
